## Arrival! (Start Session Here)

### Bridge

> You stand at the edge of a **raised and broken causeway** under a hazy, **twilit** sky. The causeway, which is built from pale stones that **glow faintly from within**, towers over the surrounding landscape, but large **sections of it have crumbled away**. The parts that remain in place are separated by large gaps where portions have collapsed.

### Swamp

> A **fog-shrouded swamp** spreads out below you in all directions, and up from its murk wafts the **smell of rotting plants**. Also rising from the swamp is the music of nature—a discordant symphony of **croaking frogs and singing birds**.

### Balloon Crash

> In the distant sky, you spot a **great balloon** made of **patchwork material**. It **spins out of control** as though punctured, causing the wicker basket that hangs from it to **swing wildly**. The balloon **plunges out of sight**, disappearing into the fog approximately a mile away.

## Reaching the Bridge Bottom

### Landing

> **Sticky mud** squelches beneath your feet. **Tangled mangroves** grow out of pools of rippling water, half hidden by the **thick fog**, and **purple mushrooms** cling to rotting logs and stumps scattered throughout the marsh. **Crickets that glow like fireflies** chirp serenely before they’re snatched out of the air by the tongues of hungry frogs.

## Brigand Encounter!

> Coming from one direction are **several voices joined in a marching song**. The singing grows louder as **six bipedal rabbits** wearing clothing emerge from the fog. Two of them tug at the reins of a **giant snail**, and the others carry **clubs and slings**.

### Harengon Brigand Song

    With sticks and stones, we’ll break your nose;
    We’ll beat you blind and steal your clothes.
    But none among us can compare
    To one wily, swift, and stand-up hare—
    Scarf that’s glorious, thief notorious,
    His deeds are truly meritorious!

    With a wink and a grin, he’ll show his cunning;
    A flash of his scarf, he’ll take off running.
    Quick as a bolt, his long scarf trailing,
    Gasping, grasping, you’ll end up flailing.
    You’ll pout, you’ll moan, you’ll huff, you’ll sneer;
    Thanks to Agdon Longscarf, brigand prince of Prismeer!

### The Harengons

- Jebbek ( the leader )
- Thunderbolt ( the snail )
- Two riders, and three brigands on foot
  
> This is a robbery! If you resist, we'll beat you black and blue.

### Demands

> "Think of the best gift that you ever recieved.  Now surrender that feeling of delight to us."  They hold out a __stoppered gourd__ that sports a __golden knob__.

        Write it on your character sheet somewhere.

If they turn them over

        Agdon Longscarf is much abliged!!!

If they resist

        Intimidate DC 13 (group)
        on failure: fight (non-lethal) until bunnies flee

## Locations

### 1. Slanty Tower

> A __crumbling stone tower__ rises out of the swamp, leaning at such an angle that it __threatens to keel over__. __Black brambles surround the base of the tower__ and cling to its lower half. Hanging from the crenellations on the lower side of the tower’s peak is a __large woven basket__ at the end of a tangle of ropes and tattered fabric. The basket __dangles thirty feet__ above the surface of the swamp.

#### A Plea for Help

> “I’m in a bit of a bind, as you can observe. I, Sir Talavar, as one of the Summer Queen’s loyal servants, ask that you free me. You see, I was in the midst of a daring escape from the vile Bavlorna Blightstraw when our balloon was set upon by an ill wind and sent plummeting to its current unfortunate location. My pilot, the honorable Wigglewog, did not survive. I’ve been trapped up here for a while now. Help me. I must tell my queen of the fall of Prismeer!”

#### The state of things.

* Sir Talavar is a noble faerie dragon.
* He serves the Seelie court and the Titania the Summer Queen.
* He is locked in a magic sealing silver birdcage.
* Wigglewog the bullywog is dead (sympathetic and helped him escape).  
* Blightstraw sent snakes to capture and bring him back.

Two sleeping snakes reside in the brambles below.

        Perception DC 15 to spot.
        Persuasion DC 12 to make snakes leave.

Reward: 

        Rule of Reciprocity:
        +1 Dagger (his sword) (on being freed from cage)
        Summer Queen:
        Leaves a gift on the threshhold of the Palace of Heart's Desire. (chapter 3)

#### What he knows

* Bavlorna Blightstraw lives in a __spooky cottage on stilts__ at the __heart of Downfall__, a bullywug settlement. The bullywugs of Downfall are quite __courteous and welcoming__, provided one does not offend them.
* Bavlorna has the __ability to conjure__ minions that look like __tiny versions of herself__.
* Bavlorna has __two sisters__ whom she loathes. Together, the three hags form the __Hourglass Coven__. Using an artifact called __Iggwilv’s Cauldron__, the coven has __frozen time in Zybilna’s palace__, trapping the archfey inside.
* A goblin named __Jingle Jangle__ has the __key__ to Sir Talavar’s birdcage. She lives atop __Telemy Hill__, not too far from Slanty Tower.

### 2. Telemy Hill

> You are greeted by the __scent of sweet-smelling fruit__. Damp, downy, __silvery-green moss__ blankets a gentle upward slope before giving way to a __craggy ridge__ that marks the top of the hill. Dozens of __enormous willow trees__ dot the hillside, __swaying as though in a breeze despite__ the __absence__ of one.

#### The state of the hill

* Telemy hill is sentient and travels around.
* It's friend Jingle Jangle was out looking for truffles and was ambushed by brigands.
* She's recovering/resting in her den and the hill is worried


#### Climbing the hill

Players are approached by 1d4 + 1 awakend trees.

        Welcome to Telemy Hill.  How long do you plan to stay?

#### What the trees know

* Jingle Jangle is friendly, collects keys, and talks about them endlessly.
* She wears a coat of keys that jingle and jangle as she walks
* Three days ago, while rooting through the swamp for truffles, she was attacked and robbed by brigands. She hasn’t left her hilltop den since returning to the hill and must be pretty hungry by now.
* The trees will do what they can to drive aggressive players away from the hill.

#### Entering Jingle's Den

> Worn __stone steps__ lead down into what feels like a __cellar__. It’s __chilly__ in here, and you detect a subtle __scent of iron__ in the air. From a distant spot within the chamber, sputtering candles illuminate a __multitude of keys__ dangling from __taut strings__ that crisscross the walls. Hundreds of other keys lie __strewn across the dirt floor__.

#### Jingle Appears

> As you take in the scene, you hear the sound of keys jingling as a goblin emerges from the dimness. She wears a __coat lined with metal keys__ and carries a __flail that has padlocks for heads__. She manages a faint smile and says, “__How might Jingle Jangle unlock a bit of happiness in your lives today?__”

Jingle will freely give away the silver key.

        Better you should have it than those long-eared brigands. First they stole Jingle Jangle’s truffles. Next, they’ll want Jingle Jangle’s keys. Someone ought to give them a good shaking down so they know what it feels like!

#### Offering Reciprocation or Showing Interest

> “Jingle Jangle was digging for truffles in the swamp when a bunch of harengons leapt out from behind the reeds and shrubbery. They took Jingle Jangle’s truffles, threw Jingle Jangle down in the mud, and whacked Jingle Jangle with their wooden clubs.”

#### Acceptable Payment

* A bag of truffles
* A thirst-quenching beverage
* A solemn vow to avenge the abuse from the brigands.

#### Reward (Jingle)

* Agdon Longscarf is the leader of the brigands.
* He is as fast as lightning and wears a blue scarf
* You could encounter him at Brigand's Tollway
* Series of old wooden catwalaks that circle a giant tree stump.  They camp atop the stump for high ground advantage
* The best guide in Higher is a pincer-clawed scarecrow named Clapperclaw.  It hangs around Downfall and knows the way to the neighboring rewalm of Thither, which is ruled by a hag named Granny Nightshade

#### Reward (Hill)
Players help Jingle
* The trees dance around the players
* One tree gives them an iron key that Jingle dropped
* Tree says it will be useful later on

Players hurt Jingle
* Players will be attacked by 1d4 trees.
* The hill will replace trees until 10 have been felled.  Then it gives up.

#### Jingle's Deal with Blightstraw

> Jingle used to terribly fear being caught on the **wrong side of a locked door** wherever she went.  She asked the hag to **undo this "terrible curse"**.  The hag replaced the fear with an **insatiable and overwhelming need to collect keys**.  The obsession is so great that Jingle has **lost sense of self** and speaks only in the third person.


### 3. Brigansds' Tollway

> A foggy marsh stretches out before you.  **Rickety causeways** mdae of wooden planks forma  wide, web-like structure above the bog.  THree hundred feet away, many of these causeways converge on an enormous, ivy-covered tree stump that rises a good ten feet above the twenty-foot-high fog bank that enshrouds it.

        Running on causeway: 1d8 (on 7 or 8) part falls away Dex DC:10 to avoid falling.  Lands prone in mud and restrained. Strength DC:10 to get out.

All along the causeway:
> An odd feeling suddenly comes over you as you become aware that somewhere along the way, a hunched, hooded figure has joined the group.

Agdon has two skiffs backing him up.  The skiffs contain three brigands and a sniper.

Dealing with Agdon:

        Grab the scarf: DC 17 Strength
        Agdon can't move more than 15 feet from 
        the character.  Strength contest.
        Immediately surrenders like a bitch
        when he loses.

Backstory:  Zybilna cursed Agdon to never be able to remove the scarf after he refused to give it up.
She then nailed it to a tree and caused the tree to grow.  Agdon struck a deal with Bavlorna to remove the nail from his scarf.  He has to give her one item from each person he steals from.

### 4. Downfall...

### Other Encounters:

#### Mud Mephits
This encounter can occur when the swamp’s water level is low. **Five mud mephits** emerge from the muck around the characters and **threaten to drag them down** into it **unless they can guess the mephits’ favorite food**. The answer, of course, is **mud pie**. Each character gets one guess. If a character guesses correctly, the mephits cackle maniacally, dive back under the muck, and disappear. If no character guesses correctly, one mephit blurts out the answer as they attack. **If two or more mephits are killed** in the ensuing fracas, the rest **dive into the muck** on their next turn and **disappear**.

#### Marsh Gas
**Iridescent bubbles** arise from the muck
THey pop when they touch something edged like a twig or blade of grass.  The gas releases with the sound of **stifled laughter**.  Smells like **old cheese**

Crossing a field of marsh gas.

        Survival DC 10 group
        on failure
        Constitution DC 10

Effects:

- 1–3 **Babble Gas**. Whenever the character speaks, their words come out as **gibberish** that only the **character and others affected by the gas can understand**. This effect does not impede the character’s ability to cast spells that have verbal components.
- 4–5 **Hiccupping Gas**. The character experiences a most annoying case of the **hiccups**. To cast a spell that has a **verbal component, the character must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution check**. Also, the character has **disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide**.
- 6–7 **Warting Gas**. Hideous warts erupt across the character’s body. The warts are unattractive but have no harmful effect.
- 8 **Bittertongue Gas**. A foul taste fills the character’s mouth, and everything the character eats or drinks tastes awful. **Slugs** appear to be the only exception; they taste like **ripe cherries**.
